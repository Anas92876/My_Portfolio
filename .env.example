# Email Configuration for Contact Form
# These environment variables are required for the contact form to work

# HOW IT WORKS:
# - EMAIL_USER = YOUR email account that SENDS emails on behalf of your website
# - EMAIL_TO = YOUR inbox where you RECEIVE form submissions
# - User's email from form = Automatically used as "Reply-To" so you can respond directly

# SMTP Host (e.g., smtp.gmail.com, smtp-mail.outlook.com)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com

# SMTP Port (587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)
EMAIL_PORT=587

# Use SSL/TLS (true for port 465, false for port 587)
EMAIL_SECURE=false

# YOUR email account that will send emails (NOT the user's email)
# This is YOUR email that acts as the SMTP server
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com

# Email account password or app-specific password
# For Gmail: Use App Password (https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833)
# For Outlook: Use regular password or app password
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# The email address that will appear in the "From" field (should be same as EMAIL_USER)
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com

# YOUR inbox where you want to RECEIVE contact form submissions
EMAIL_TO=mhab36817@gmail.com
